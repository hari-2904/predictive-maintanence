# Predictive Maintenance Dataset

## Overview

This dataset is provided by a company that operates a fleet of devices transmitting daily sensor readings. The company aims to develop a predictive maintenance solution to proactively identify when maintenance should be performed. Predictive maintenance offers cost savings over routine or time-based preventive maintenance, as tasks are executed only when necessary.

The task is to build a predictive model using machine learning to forecast the probability of a device failure. It is crucial to minimize false positives and false negatives in the predictions. The target column to predict is named "failure," with binary values: 0 for non-failure and 1 for failure.

## Dataset Description

- **Features**: The dataset contains various sensor readings and operational parameters of the devices. These features are used as input for the predictive model.
  
- **Target Variable**: The target variable, named "failure," indicates whether a device has failed (1) or not (0).

## Task

The primary objective is to develop a predictive model using classification algorithms to predict the failure of machines accurately. The model should minimize false positives and false negatives to ensure efficient maintenance scheduling.

## Approach

The following steps were undertaken to build the predictive maintenance solution:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand the dataset's characteristics, identify patterns, and explore relationships between features and the target variable.

2. **Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, scale features if necessary, and encode categorical variables.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features or transform existing features to improve model performance.

4. **Model Selection**: Evaluate various classification algorithms suitable for predictive maintenance tasks, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.

5. **Model Training**: Train the selected models on the dataset, using appropriate techniques such as cross-validation.

6. **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using relevant metrics, considering the imbalance in the target variable and the importance of minimizing false positives and false negatives.

7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model hyperparameters to improve predictive accuracy.

## Conclusion

By leveraging machine learning techniques and predictive maintenance models, the company can efficiently schedule maintenance tasks, reducing downtime and operational costs while ensuring optimal device performance.
